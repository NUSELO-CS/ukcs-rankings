# ukcs-rankings

This is a BETA port of the original ukcs-rankings methodology to a fully automated project and open-sourced model.

## Methodology

Players play in UKCS events, UKCS leagues and international leagues. This ranking system combines players results to generate rankings of the teams.

### Components
- UKIC - Division,Placement
- ESEA - Division,Wins
- UKCS Events - Event Tier, Placement

### Rankings & Seeding

At this point the ranking is still having all components fully and correctly ported over. It is the aim in a couple of weeks the model will be appropriate enough to be used for that.


### Updates to the model

The model will be updated, improved and reviewed over the coming weeks. Feel free to make any PR's or raise issues to modify the code. In the coming weeks graphs will be produced to better explain the point component system as well as the breakdown system being enhanced with more details
